# Checks:
# 1. We have a clean checkout
# 2. A remote is configured
# 3. The branch has been pushed to the remote
# 4. The version we are deploying matches the remote

# These environment variables are available:
# MRSK_RECORDED_AT
# MRSK_PERFORMER
# MRSK_VERSION
# MRSK_HOSTS
# MRSK_ROLE (if set)
# MRSK_DESTINATION (if set)
# MRSK_RUNTIME
