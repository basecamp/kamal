# Roles
#
# Roles are used to configure different types of servers in the deployment.
# The most common use for this is to run a web servers and job servers.
#
# Kamal expects there to be a `web` role, unless you set a different `primary_role`
# in the root configuration.

# Role configuration
#
# Roles are specified under the servers key
servers:

  # Simple role configuration
  #
  #
  # This can be a list of hosts, if you don't need custom configuration for the role.
  #
  # You can set tags on the hosts for custom env variables (see kamal docs env)
  web:
    - 172.1.0.1
    - 172.1.0.2: experiment1
    - 172.1.0.2: [ experiment1, experiment2 ]

  # Custom role configuration
  #
  # When there are other options to set, the list of hosts goes under the `hosts` key
  #
  # By default only the primary role uses Traefik, but you can set `traefik` to change
  # it.
  #
  # You can also set a custom cmd to run in the container, and overwrite other settings
  # from the root configuration.
