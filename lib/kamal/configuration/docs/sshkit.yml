# SSHKit
#
# [SSHKit](https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit) is the SSH toolkit used by Kamal.
#
# The default, settings should be sufficient for most use cases, but
# when connecting to a large number of hosts, you may need to adjust.

# SSHKit options
#
# The options are specified under the sshkit key in the configuration file.
sshkit:

  # Max concurrent starts
  #
  # Creating SSH connections concurrently can be an issue when deploying to many servers.
  # By default, Kamal will limit concurrent connection starts to 30 at a time.
  max_concurrent_starts: 10

  # Pool idle timeout
  #
  # Kamal sets a long idle timeout of 900 seconds on connections to try to avoid
  # re-connection storms after an idle period, such as building an image or waiting for CI.
  pool_idle_timeout: 300

  # Default Env
  #
  # SSHKit sessions do not inherit the host PATH value. If you need to set custom env vars on 
  # a SSHKit session, like PATH or DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM you can map them here.
  default_env:
    path: /usr/local/bin:$PATH"
