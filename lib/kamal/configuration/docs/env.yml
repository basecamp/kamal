# Environment variables
#
# Environment variables can be set directory in the Kamal configuration or
# for loaded from a .env file, for secrets that should not be checked into Git.

# Reading environment variables from the configuration
#
# Environment variables can be set directly in the configuration file.
#
# These are passed to the docker run command when deploying.
env:
  DATABASE_HOST: mysql-db1
  DATABASE_PORT: 3306

# Using .env file to load required environment variables
#
# Kamal uses dotenv to automatically load environment variables set in the .env file present
# in the application root.
#
# This file can be used to set variables like KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD or database passwords.
# But for this reason you must ensure that .env files are not checked into Git or included
# in your Dockerfile! The format is just key-value like:
# ```
# KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=pw
# DB_PASSWORD=secret123
# ```
# See https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/commands/envify/ for how to use generated .env files.
#
# To pass the secrets you should list them under the `secret` key. When you do this the
# other variables need to be moved under the `clear` key.
#
# Unlike clear valies, secrets are not passed directly to the container,
#Â but are stored in an env file on the host
# The file is not updated when deploying, only when running `kamal envify` or `kamal env push`.
env:
  clear:
    DB_USER: app
  secret:
    - DB_PASSWORD

# Tags
#
# Tags are used to add extra env variables to specific hosts.
# See kamal docs servers for how to tag hosts.
#
# Tags are only allowed in the top level env configuration (i.e not under a role specific env).
#
# The env variables can be specified with secret and clear values as explained above.
env:
  tags:
    <tag1>:
      MYSQL_USER: monitoring
    <tag2>:
      clear:
        MYSQL_USER: readonly
      secret:
        - MYSQL_PASSWORD

# Example configuration
env:
  clear:
    MYSQL_USER: app
  secret:
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD
  tags:
    monitoring:
      MYSQL_USER: monitoring
    replica:
      clear:
        MYSQL_USER: readonly
      secret:
        - READONLY_PASSWORD
