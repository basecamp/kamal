# Environment variables
#
# Environment variables can be set directly in the Kamal configuration or
# read from `.kamal/secrets`.

# Reading environment variables from the configuration
#
# Environment variables can be set directly in the configuration file.
#
# These are passed to the `docker run` command when deploying.
env:
  DATABASE_HOST: mysql-db1
  DATABASE_PORT: 3306

# Secrets
#
# Kamal uses dotenv to automatically load environment variables set in the `.kamal/secrets` file.
#
# If you are using destinations, secrets will instead be read from `.kamal/secrets.<DESTINATION>` if
# it exists.
#
# Common secrets across all destinations can be set in `.kamal/secrets-common`.
#
# This file can be used to set variables like `KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` or database passwords.
# You can use variable or command substitution in the secrets file.
#
# ```shell
# KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
# RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(cat config/master.key)
# ```
#
# You can also use [secret helpers](../../commands/secrets) for some common password managers.
#
# ```shell
# SECRETS=$(kamal secrets fetch ...)
#
# REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(kamal secrets extract REGISTRY_PASSWORD $SECRETS)
# DB_PASSWORD=$(kamal secrets extract DB_PASSWORD $SECRETS)
# ```
#
# If you store secrets directly in `.kamal/secrets`, ensure that it is not checked into version control.
#
# To pass the secrets, you should list them under the `secret` key. When you do this, the
# other variables need to be moved under the `clear` key.
#
# Unlike clear values, secrets are not passed directly to the container
# but are stored in an env file on the host:
env:
  clear:
    DB_USER: app
  secret:
    - DB_PASSWORD

# Tags
#
# Tags are used to add extra env variables to specific hosts.
# See kamal docs servers for how to tag hosts.
#
# Tags are only allowed in the top-level env configuration (i.e., not under a role-specific env).
#
# The env variables can be specified with secret and clear values as explained above.
env:
  tags:
    <tag1>:
      MYSQL_USER: monitoring
    <tag2>:
      clear:
        MYSQL_USER: readonly
      secret:
        - MYSQL_PASSWORD

# Example configuration
env:
  clear:
    MYSQL_USER: app
  secret:
    - MYSQL_PASSWORD
  tags:
    monitoring:
      MYSQL_USER: monitoring
    replica:
      clear:
        MYSQL_USER: readonly
      secret:
        - READONLY_PASSWORD
