# Accessories
#
# Accessories can be booted on a single host, a list of hosts, or on specific roles.
# The hosts do not need to be defined in the Kamal servers configuration.
#
# Accessories are managed separately from the main service - they are not updated
# when you deploy and they do not have zero-downtime deployments.
#
# Run `kamal accessory boot <accessory>` to boot an accessory.
# See `kamal accessory --help` for more information.

# Configuring accessories
#
# First define the accessory in the `accessories`
accessories:
  mysql:

    # Service name
    #
    # This is used in the service label and defaults to `<service>-<accessory>`
    # where `<service>` is the main service name from the root configuration
    service: mysql

    # Image
    #
    # The Docker image to use, prefix with a registry if not using Docker hub
    image: mysql:8.0

    # Accessory hosts
    #
    # Specify one  of `host`, `hosts` or `roles`
    host: mysql-db1
    hosts:
      - mysql-db1
      - mysql-db2
    roles:
      - mysql

    # Custom command
    #
    # You can set a custom command to run in the container, if you do not want to use the default
    cmd: "bin/mysqld"

    # Port mappings
    #
    # See https://docs.docker.com/network/, especially note the warning about the security
    # implications of exposing ports publicly.
    port: "127.0.0.1:3306:3306"

    # Labels
    labels:
      app: myapp

    # Environment variables

    # Copying files
    #
    # You can specify files to mount into the container.
    # The format is `local:remote` where `local` is the path to the file on the local machine
    # and `remote` is the path to the file in the container.
    #
    # They will be uploaded from the local repo to the host and then mounted.
    #
    # ERB files will be evaluated before being copied.
    files:
      - config/my.cnf.erb:/etc/mysql/my.cnf
      - config/myoptions.cnf:/etc/mysql/myoptions.cnf

    # Directories
    #
    # You can specify directories to mount into the container. They will be created on the host
    # before being mounted
    directories:
      - mysql-logs:/var/log/mysql

    # Volumes
    #
    # Any other volumes to mount, in addition to the files and directories.
    # They are not created or copied before mounting
    volumes:
      - /path/to/mysql-logs:/var/log/mysql
