# Builder
#
# The builder configuration controls how the application is built with `docker build`
#
# If no configuration is specified, Kamal will:
# 1. Create a buildx context called `kamal-local-docker-container`, using the docker-container driver
# 2. Use `docker build` to build a multiarch image for linux/amd64,linux/arm64 with that context
#
# See https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/configuration/builder-examples/ for more information

# Builder options
#
# Options go under the builder key in the root configuration.
builder:
  # Driver
  #
  # The build driver to use, defaults to `docker-container`
  driver: docker

  # Arch
  #
  # The architectures to build for, defaults to `[ amd64, arm64 ]`
  # Unless you are using the docker driver, when it defaults to the local architecture
  # You can set an array or just a single value
  arch:
    - amd64

  # Remote configuration
  #
  # If you have a remote builder, you can configure it here
  remote: ssh://docker@docker-builder

  # Builder cache
  #
  # The type must be either 'gha' or 'registry'
  #
  # The image is only used for registry cache. Not compatible with the docker driver
  cache:
    type: registry
    options: mode=max
    image: kamal-app-build-cache

  # Build context
  #
  # If this is not set, then a local git clone of the repo is used.
  # This ensures a clean build with no uncommitted changes.
  #
  # To use the local checkout instead you can set the context to `.`, or a path to another directory.
  context: .

  # Dockerfile
  #
  # The Dockerfile to use for building, defaults to `Dockerfile`
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.production

  # Build target
  #
  # If not set, then the default target is used
  target: production

  # Build Arguments
  #
  # Any additional build arguments, passed to `docker build` with `--build-arg <key>=<value>`
  args:
    ENVIRONMENT: production

  # Referencing build arguments
  #
  # ```shell
  # ARG RUBY_VERSION
  # FROM ruby:$RUBY_VERSION-slim as base
  # ```

  # Build secrets
  #
  # Values are read from the environment.
  #
  secrets:
    - SECRET1
    - SECRET2

  # Referencing Build Secrets
  #
  # ```shell
  # # Copy Gemfiles
  # COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock ./
  #
  # # Install dependencies, including private repositories via access token
  # # Then remove bundle cache with exposed GITHUB_TOKEN)
  # RUN --mount=type=secret,id=GITHUB_TOKEN \
  #   BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM=x-access-token:$(cat /run/secrets/GITHUB_TOKEN) \
  #   bundle install && \
  #   rm -rf /usr/local/bundle/cache
  # ```


  # SSH
  #
  # SSH agent socket or keys to expose to the build
  ssh: default=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK
