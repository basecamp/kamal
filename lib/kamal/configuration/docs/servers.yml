# Servers
#
# Servers are split into different roles, with each role having its own configuration.
#
# For simpler deployments though where all servers are identical, you can just specify a list of servers
# They will be implicitly assigned to the `web` role.
servers:
  - 172.0.0.1
  - 172.0.0.2
  - 172.0.0.3

# Tagging servers
#
# Servers can be tagged, with the tags used to add custom env variables (see kamal docs env).
servers:
  - 172.0.0.1
  - 172.0.0.2: experiments
  - 172.0.0.3: [ experiments, three ]

# Roles
#
# For more complex deployments (e.g. if you are running job hosts), you can specify roles, and configure each separately (see kamal docs role)
servers:
  web:

  workers:
