# Kamal Configuration
#
# Configuration is read from the `config/deploy.yml`
#
# When running commands, you can specify a destination with the `-d` flag,
# e.g. `kamal deploy -d staging`
#
# In this case the configuration will also be read from `config/deploy.staging.yml`
# and merged with the base configuration.
#
# The available configuration options are explained below.

# The service name
# This is a required value. It is used as the container name prefix.
service: myapp

# The Docker image name
#
# The image will be pushed to the configured registry.
image: my-image

# Labels
#
# Additional labels to add to the container
labels:
  my-label: my-value

# Additional volumes to mount into the container
volumes:
  - /path/on/host:/path/in/container:ro

# Registry

# Environment variables

# See kamal docs env
env:

# Asset Bridging
#
# Used for asset bridging across deployments, default to `nil`
#
# If there are changes to CSS or JS files, we may get requests
# for the old versions on the new container and vice-versa.
#
# To avoid 404s we can specify an asset path.
# Kamal will replace that path in the container with a mapped
# volume containing both sets of files.
# This requires that file names change when the contents change
# (e.g. by including a hash of the contents in the name).

# To configure this, set the path to the assets:
asset_path: /path/to/assets

# Path to hooks, defaults to `.kamal/hooks`
# See https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/hooks for more information
hooks_path: /user_home/kamal/hooks

# Require destinations
#
# Whether deployments require a destination to be specified, defaults to `false`
require_destination: true

# The primary role
#
# This defaults to `web`, but if you have no web role, you can change this
primary_role: workers

# Allowing empty roles
#
# Whether roles with no servers are allowed. Defaults to `false`.
allow_empty_roles: false

# Stop wait time
#
# How long we wait for a container to stop before killing it, defaults to 30 seconds
stop_wait_time: 60

# Retain containers
#
# How many old containers and images we retain, defaults to 5
retain_containers: 3

# Minimum version
#
# The minimum version of Kamal required to deploy this configuration, defaults to nil
minimum_version: 1.3.0

# Readiness delay
#
# Seconds to wait for a container to boot after is running, default 7
# This only applies to containers that do not specify a healthcheck
readiness_delay: 4

# Run directory
#
# Directory to store kamal runtime files in on the host, default `.kamal`
