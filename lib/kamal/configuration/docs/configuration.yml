# Kamal Configuration
#
# Configuration is read from the `config/deploy.yml`.

# Destinations
#
# When running commands, you can specify a destination with the `-d` flag,
# e.g., `kamal deploy -d staging`.
#
# In this case, the configuration will also be read from `config/deploy.staging.yml`
# and merged with the base configuration.

# Extensions
#
# Kamal will not accept unrecognized keys in the configuration file.
#
# However, you might want to declare a configuration block using YAML anchors
# and aliases to avoid repetition.
#
# You can prefix a configuration section with `x-` to indicate that it is an
# extension. Kamal will ignore the extension and not raise an error.

# The service name
#
# This is a required value. It is used as the container name prefix.
service: myapp

# The Docker image name
#
# The image will be pushed to the configured registry.
image: my-image

# Labels
#
# Additional labels to add to the container:
labels:
  my-label: my-value

# Volumes
#
# Additional volumes to mount into the container:
volumes:
  - /path/on/host:/path/in/container:ro

# Registry

# Servers

# Environment variables
#
# See kamal docs env:
env:
  ...

# Asset path
#
# Used for asset bridging across deployments, default to `nil`.
#
# If there are changes to CSS or JS files, we may get requests
# for the old versions on the new container, and vice versa.
#
# To avoid 404s, we can specify an asset path.
# Kamal will replace that path in the container with a mapped
# volume containing both sets of files.
# This requires that file names change when the contents change
# (e.g., by including a hash of the contents in the name).
#
# To configure this, set the path to the assets:
asset_path: /path/to/assets

# Hooks path
#
# Path to hooks, defaults to `.kamal/hooks`.
# See https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/hooks for more information:
hooks_path: /user_home/kamal/hooks

# Error pages
#
# A directory relative to the app root to find error pages for the proxy to serve.
# Any files in the format 4xx.html or 5xx.html will be copied to the hosts.
error_pages_path: public

# Require destinations
#
# Whether deployments require a destination to be specified, defaults to `false`:
require_destination: true

# Primary role
#
# This defaults to `web`, but if you have no web role, you can change this:
primary_role: workers

# Allowing empty roles
#
# Whether roles with no servers are allowed. Defaults to `false`:
allow_empty_roles: false

# Retain containers
#
# How many old containers and images we retain, defaults to 5:
retain_containers: 3

# Minimum version
#
# The minimum version of Kamal required to deploy this configuration, defaults to `nil`:
minimum_version: 1.3.0

# Readiness delay
#
# Seconds to wait for a container to boot after it is running, default 7.
#
# This only applies to containers that do not run a proxy or specify a healthcheck:
readiness_delay: 4

# Deploy timeout
#
# How long to wait for a container to become ready, default 30:
deploy_timeout: 10

# Drain timeout
#
# How long to wait for a container to drain, default 30:
drain_timeout: 10

# Run directory
#
# Directory to store kamal runtime files in on the host, default `.kamal`:
run_directory: /etc/kamal
