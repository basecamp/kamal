# SSH configuration
#
# Kamal uses SSH to connect run commands on your hosts.
# By default it will attempt to connect to the root user on port 22
#
# If you are using non-root user, you may need to bootstrap your servers manually, before using them with Kamal. On Ubuntu, you’d do:
#
# ```shell
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt upgrade -y
# sudo apt install -y docker.io curl git
# sudo usermod -a -G docker app
# ```


# SSH options
#
# The options are specified under the ssh key in the configuration file.
ssh:

  # The SSH user
  #
  # Defaults to `root`
  #
  user: app

  # The SSH port
  #
  # Defaults to 22
  port: "2222"

  # Proxy host
  #
  # Specified in the form <host> or <user>@<host>
  proxy: root@proxy-host

  # Proxy command
  #
  # A custom proxy command, required for older versions of SSH
  proxy_command: "ssh -W %h:%p user@proxy"

  # Log level
  #
  # Defaults to `fatal`. Set this to debug if you are having
  # SSH connection issues.
  log_level: debug
