# SSH configuration
#
# Kamal uses SSH to connect and run commands on your hosts.
# By default, it will attempt to connect to the root user on port 22.
#
# If you are using a non-root user, you may need to bootstrap your servers manually before using them with Kamal. On Ubuntu, youâ€™d do:
#
# ```shell
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt upgrade -y
# sudo apt install -y docker.io curl git
# sudo usermod -a -G docker app
# ```

# SSH options
#
# The options are specified under the ssh key in the configuration file.
ssh:

  # The SSH user
  #
  # Defaults to `root`:
  user: app

  # The SSH port
  #
  # Defaults to 22:
  port: "2222"

  # Proxy host
  #
  # Specified in the form <host> or <user>@<host>:
  proxy: root@proxy-host

  # Proxy command
  #
  # A custom proxy command, required for older versions of SSH:
  proxy_command: "ssh -W %h:%p user@proxy"

  # Log level
  #
  # Defaults to `fatal`. Set this to `debug` if you are having SSH connection issues.
  log_level: debug

  # Keys only
  #
  # Set to `true` to use only private keys from the `keys` and `key_data` parameters,
  # even if ssh-agent offers more identities. This option is intended for
  # situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities or you
  # need to overwrite all identities and force a single one.
  keys_only: false

  # Keys
  #
  # An array of file names of private keys to use for public key
  # and host-based authentication:
  keys: [ "~/.ssh/id.pem" ]

  # Key data
  #
  # An array of strings, with each element of the array being
  # a raw private key in PEM format.
  key_data: [ "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----" ]

  # Config
  #
  # Set to true to load the default OpenSSH config files (~/.ssh/config,
  # /etc/ssh_config), to false ignore config files, or to a file path
  # to load specific configuration. Defaults to true.
  config: true
