# SSH configuration
#
# Kamal uses SSH to connect run commands on your hosts.
# By default it will attempt to connect to the root user on port 22
#
# If you are using non-root user, you may need to bootstrap your servers manually, before using them with Kamal. On Ubuntu, you’d do:
#
# ```shell
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt upgrade -y
# sudo apt install -y docker.io curl git
# sudo usermod -a -G docker app
# ```


# SSH options
#
# The options are specified under the ssh key in the configuration file.
ssh:

  # The SSH user
  #
  # Defaults to `root`
  #
  user: app

  # The SSH port
  #
  # Defaults to 22
  port: "2222"

  # Proxy host
  #
  # Specified in the form <host> or <user>@<host>
  proxy: root@proxy-host

  # Proxy command
  #
  # A custom proxy command, required for older versions of SSH
  proxy_command: "ssh -W %h:%p user@proxy"

  # Log level
  #
  # Defaults to `fatal`. Set this to debug if you are having
  # SSH connection issues.
  log_level: debug

  # Keys Only
  #
  # Set to true to use only private keys from keys and key_data parameters, 
  # even if ssh-agent offers more identities. This option is intended for 
  # situations where ssh-agent offers many different identites or you have 
  # a need to overwrite all identites and force a single one.
  keys_only: false

  # Keys
  #
  # An array of file names of private keys to use for publickey
  # and hostbased authentication
  keys: [ "~/.ssh/id.pem" ]

  # Key Data
  #
  # An array of strings, with each element of the array being
  # a raw private key in PEM format.
  key_data: [ "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----" ]

  # Config
  #
  # Set to true to load the default OpenSSH config files (~/.ssh/config,
  # /etc/ssh_config), to false ignore config files, or to a file path
  # (or array of paths) to load specific configuration. Defaults to true.
  config: true
