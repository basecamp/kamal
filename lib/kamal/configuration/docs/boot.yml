# Booting
#
# When deploying to large numbers of hosts, you might prefer not to restart your services on every host at the same time.
#
# Kamal’s default is to boot new containers on all hosts in parallel. However, you can control this with the boot configuration.

# Fixed group sizes
#
# Here, we boot 2 hosts at a time with a 10-second gap between each group:
boot:
  limit: 2
  wait: 10

# Percentage of hosts
#
# Here, we boot 25% of the hosts at a time with a 2-second gap between each group:
boot:
  limit: 25%
  wait: 2
