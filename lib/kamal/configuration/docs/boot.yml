# Booting
#
# When deploying to large numbers of hosts, you might prefer not to restart your services on every host at the same time.
#
# Kamal’s default is to boot new containers on all hosts in parallel. However, you can control this with the boot configuration.

boot:

  # The number or percentage of hosts to boot at a time.
  # This can be an integer (e.g., 3) or a percentage string (e.g., 25%).
  limit: 25%

  # The number of seconds to wait between booting each group of hosts.
  wait: 10

  # Whether to boot roles in parallel on a host.
  #
  # If a host has multiple roles, control whether they are booted in parallel or sequentially on that host.
  #
  # Defaults to false.
  parallel_roles: true
