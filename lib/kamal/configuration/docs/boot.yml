# Booting
#
# When deploying to large numbers of hosts, you might prefer not to restart your services on every host at the same time.
#
# Kamalâ€™s default is to boot new containers on all hosts in parallel. But you can control this with the boot configuration.

# Fixed group sizes
#
# Here we boot 2 hosts at a time with a 10 second gap between each group.
boot:
  limit: 2
  wait: 10

# Percentage of hosts
#
# Here we boot 25% of the hosts at a time with a 2 second gap between each group.
boot:
  limit: 25%
  wait: 2
