# Aliases
#
# Aliases are shortcuts for Kamal commands.
#
# For example, for a Rails app, you might open a console with:
#
# ```shell
# kamal app exec -i --reuse "bin/rails console"
# ```
#
# By defining an alias, like this:
aliases:
  console: app exec -i --reuse "bin/rails console"
# You can now open the console with:
#
# ```shell
# kamal console
# ```

# Configuring aliases
#
# Aliases are defined in the root config under the alias key.
#
# Each alias is named and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores:
aliases:
  uname: app exec -p -q -r web "uname -a"
