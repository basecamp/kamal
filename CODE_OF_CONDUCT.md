# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the MRSK project, we pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. We value the participation of each member of our community and want all contributors to feel respected and valued.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all MRSK project spaces, including but not limited to project code, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists. Violations of this code of conduct may result in removal from the project community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a project maintainer. All reports will be kept confidential and will be reviewed and investigated promptly.

We will investigate every complaint and take appropriate action. We reserve the right to remove any content that violates this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that we deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
